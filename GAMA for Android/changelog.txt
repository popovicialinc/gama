## Visual and Animation Enhancements
- Introduced fully dynamic particle-based animated background system replacing the static gradient overlay
- Added device rotation parallax effect with refined sensitivity and clamping for natural response
- Implemented three background modes: standard upward particle flow, static star field, and smart time-based mode with day/night behavior
- Added real-time sun and moon celestial animation with smooth parabolic arc trajectory synchronized to device clock
- Overhauled motion system with comprehensive MotionTokens for durations, easings, springs, and scale values for consistent premium animations
- Enhanced overall animation fidelity with improved damping, velocity clamping, and frame-rate normalization in particle physics

## New Features
- Added Excluded Apps management panel allowing users to selectively exclude applications from GPU API changes
- Introduced detailed Aggressive Mode warning dialog with expanded side-effect explanations
- Added GPUWatch confirmation dialog with custom terminal-style icon and direct navigation to Developer Options
- Implemented test notification function for developer verification

## Improvements
- Added safe font loading fallback to system default if custom Quicksand fonts are unavailable
- Introduced OLED mode support in buttons and dialogs for true-black compatibility
- Refined particle update logic with better edge wrapping, momentum preservation, and mode-specific behavior
- Improved celestial positioning with more natural sunrise/sunset and moonrise/moonset transitions
- Updated various dialog layouts for better readability, spacing, and visual hierarchy
- Expanded imports and dependencies to support advanced Compose features including graphicsLayer, lazy lists, and coroutine frame timing

## Under the Hood
- Significantly expanded codebase with new data classes (ParticleState, CelestialState) and utility functions
- Improved haptic feedback integration and back-handler consistency
- Enhanced theme and color application across new components
- General code organization and cleanup for maintainability

This release focuses on delivering a significantly more immersive and polished user experience while adding practical new functionality for advanced users.
