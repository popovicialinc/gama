# ✅Overview

GAMA (GPU API Manager for Android-based devices) is a Windows batch script that changes your Android device’s GPU API  — no root needed. 

It’s tailor-made for One UI 7 users battling overheating, throttled performance, and suboptimal battery life, especially S23 users - Forcing Vulkan rendering is a great way to enhance performance, increase battery life and lower running temperatures.

# 🧩Prerequisites
* A Windows PC
* The latest version of [GAMA](https://github.com/popovicialinc/gama/releases/latest)

# 📦Installation & Usage
* Extract the GAMA archive
* Double-click "gama-core.bat"

**Heads up: You’ll need to run this script after every phone reboot.**

# ⚠️Known issues (list may expand in the future)
## Caused by Vulkan
* **Visual artifacting**. Adreno GPUs aboard Snapdragon SOCs usually have no problems with Vulkan, so your mileage may vary - though my personal experience with Vulkan has been great on my S23 Ultra.

## Caused by system-wide app restart (aggressive app stop)
* **The default browser and the default keyboard will get reset.**
* **Loss of WiFi-Calling/VoLTE capability** - **Fix**: Go to Settings > Connections > SIM manager, then toggle SIM 1/2 off and back on. (many thanks to Fun-Flight4427 and ActualMountain7899 for reporting the bug and finding a solution)

# ✨Frequently asked question

**Q: Why bother with Vulkan?**
A: Vulkan is a newer, low‑overhead graphics API. One UI 7 Beta 1 defaulted to Vulkan, which kept temperatures cool and battery life strong. Beta 2 reverted to OpenGL — enter overheating and drain. This script forces Vulkan back on.

**Q: Is it safe?**
A: Absolutely! It leverages official ADB commands — no system hacks, no risk.

**Q: Must I run it after every reboot?**
A: Yes, unfortunately.

**Q: How do I pronounce "GAMA"?**
A: It's pronounced exactly the same as "gamma".

**Q: Will this void my warranty or trip Knox?**
A: Nope! This doesn’t mess with bootloaders or root. It’s 100% Knox-safe and warranty-friendly.

**Q: Will it break my phone?**
A: It’s just a graphics driver toggle - your device will be just fine.

**Q: What if I don’t notice a difference?**
A: Some devices and apps won’t show a huge change, but Vulkan generally offers better performance and thermal management. If you’re not seeing improvement, your phone might already be optimized.

**Q: Can I undo this?**
A: Yup. GAMA now natively supports back-and-forth API changing - OpenGL-to-Vulkan or Vulkan-to-OpenGL. Easy peasy. Besides, a reboot wIll also reset the driver back to OpenGL, so you've got plenty of options!

**Q: Why isn’t this a built-in setting already?!**
A: Great question — ask Samsung. If you ask me, this smells a whole lot like planned obsolescence to me... but anyway.
